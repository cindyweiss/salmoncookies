  <h1> Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>
  <div>
    <p class="who"> Salmon Cookies started out as a local high school project were each graduating class student was
      asked
      to come up with a business idea that catered to the local population. When XYZ student thought about it she knew
      she wanted to combine two quintessential seattle local activites. Keeping that thought in mind XYZ student thought
      "What is more Seattle then our fish flying at Pike's Market and our coffee facination." Once those two iconic
      pasttimes were figured out it was just a matter of time before "Salmon Cookies" was born. <br>
      Salmon Cookies are a sevory bisquit like cookie to be enjoyed anytime when a light snack is needed. While we
      started off small, selling only locally to coffee shops are the market, we expanded quickly. It turned out that
      our little "cookies" had somewhat of a cult following by tourists from abroad who initially tried them while
      visiting the market. <br>
      We can now be found in five differant countries and hope to expand even more in the next five years.
